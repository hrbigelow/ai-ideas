A consequence of a distributed memory

Consider the following scenarios. In these scenarios, we consider pairs of
experiences which happen in rapid succession, and the subject forms an
assocation from the first to the second experience by storing the second
experience at the location of the first, a la Kanerva. 

I use P1, P2, P3 to indicate a set of similar patterns, and separately, Q1, Q2,
Q3 a set of similar patterns.  In general, the P's are not similar to the Q's.


Scenario 1:  Forming a new association between one experience and the one
immediately following it.

1. A person experiences P1, and then immediately following that, experiences P2.
He forms an association between P1 and P2. [write content P2 at location P1]

2. Some time later, he experiences P1 again, and it leads him to recall P2.
[read uncorrupted content P2 from location P1]

3. Immediately after this recollection, P3 occurs, which is very similar to P2.  Since it is
unsurprising

Consequence: 


Scenario 2: Experiencing an unsurprising thing.

3. He experiences P1, and recalls P2 [read from location P1, returning P2]

4. Immediately after, he experiences P3, which is very similar to P2.  The
similarity leads him to experience it as unsurprising. [compare the immediate
experience with the recalled one, finding that they are similar]  


Experiencing a totally surprising thing.

5. He experiences P1, recalls P2 [read from location P1, returning P2]

6. Immediately after, he experiences Q which is totally different than P2.
This is completely surprising as to be almost nonsensical [compare P2 with Q,
finding they are totally dissimilar]

7. He forms this new association from P1 to Q [write content Q to location P1.  due to
