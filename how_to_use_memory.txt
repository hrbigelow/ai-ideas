This is a musing on how humans use memory.

In the spirit of the idea of "The Remembered Present", I propose that the way
we use memory is in a supervisory sense.  When we experience something through
our senses, our encoding circuits calculate many different codes for different
aspects of the experience, and our memory system associates these codes with
each other in different ways, using one as an address, and the other as
contents. 

Let's consider one very simple use of memory - to compare the present situation
to an expectation based on a memory.  If in the past, you experience a certain
sequence of experiences, you would form a memory of that sequence of
experiences.  If at a later time you then experience a very similar step in
that sequence, it would be used to cue your memory for the next step in the
sequence, and you then retrieve that memory as an expectation for what comes
next.  This could serve as some sort of error signal.  The better your encoding
of a situation, the more likely it will be that a sequence of such encodings is
more predictable.  In the extreme case of a perfect encoding (in which you
model everything perfectly well, you might have modeled the actual causal model
for something and thus be able to perfectly predict the outcome.

The important point here though is that, although nature herself doesn't repeat, a
sequence of encodings of certain aspects may perfectly repeat, if it encodes the
experiences in the right way.
