RGB, CMYK seen as "color embedding".

It is instructive to think of the RGB vector as a very effective
embedding space for colors.  This has a few nice consequences.  First,
it is an embedding in the similarity sense - a mapping to a space which places
"similar" colors closer together in the space.

Second, when thinking about convolutions, the input pixels are not anything special - they
are on the same conceptual level as a feature map, and the channels have the same semantic
quality as the channels R, G, and B.
