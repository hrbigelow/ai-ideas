NEURONS WITH OVERLAPPING RECEPTIVE FIELDS

Consider a pair of neurons with overlapping receptive fields.  The fields may
completely or partially overlap.  These two neurons could either be in
competition with each other, such that each laterally inhibits the other, or
they may not be.

In the case when they are mutually laterally inhibitory, we could interpret
them as competing explanations of a pattern's presence in the receptive field.
There is just one pattern after all, so it should be accounted for by only one
neuron.

On the other hand, if the two neurons are not in competition with eachother,
then we could take a broader interpretation of their firing strengths.  Each is
optimized to detect a particular pattern, but will fire in response to patterns
nearby it in pattern space.  This allows the pair of neurons to express a
larger family of patterns.
