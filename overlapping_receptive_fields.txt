NEURONS WITH OVERLAPPING RECEPTIVE FIELDS

Consider a pair of neurons with overlapping receptive fields.  The fields may
completely or partially overlap.  These two neurons could either be in
competition with each other, such that each laterally inhibits the other, or
they may not be.

In the case when they are mutually laterally inhibitory, we could interpret
them as competing explanations of a pattern's presence in the receptive field.
There is just one pattern after all, so it should be accounted for by only one
neuron.

On the other hand, if the two neurons are not in competition with each other,
then we could take a broader interpretation of their firing strengths.  Each is
optimized to detect a particular pattern, but will fire in response to patterns
nearby it in pattern space.  This allows the pair of neurons to express a
larger family of patterns.

IS THERE BENEFIT TO HAVING MULTIPLE INPUT OR OUTPUT CHANNELS?

It's unclear to me how a convolution with multiple input and output channels is
computed.  First, consider a filter with one input and one output channel.  The
computed value is just the dot-product of filter weights with input weights,
plus a single bias term added.  Thus, it is an affine transformation of the
input, and can be implemented with a single perceptron.

Now, consider a convolution with multiple input channels but one output
channel.  This is NOT (I don't think) implemented as the sum of multiple
independent individual W x H x 1 x 1 filter applications.  In particular, I
think it only allows for a single bias term.  Also, I'm not sure whether a
nonlinear activation function is applied *before* the summing or not.

Extending this to multiple output channels though, is easy, since they are
independent calculations.  Each calculation only shares input, nothing else.
