Notes on "What is wrong with convolutional neural nets? "

6:43: "I'm gonna take a Marrian perspective, and say that in order to
understand the brain we need to understand what it is computing.  And I'm going
to give you a reason why the brain needs to do this computation.  And I suggest
this is what mini-columns are doing - a wild speculation - this is Marrian wild
speculation, because it comes from the computation that needs to be done."

26:37: Two types of equivariance.  This strikes me as somewhat clunky - I don't
know why.
