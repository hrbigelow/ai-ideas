Non-integer sampling factors in convolutions.

Ordinary convolutions (and transpose convolutions) make use of stride, which
restricts the pattern of information to a 1/stride frequency of information.
However, there is nothing stopping one from designing any sort of mask, though
logically, it ought to be a repeating pattern.  Besides being repeating, any
two patterns that, when repeated, form the same pattern that is just offset by
phase is really the same pattern.  This is a symmetry group among the patterns.

So, we could define a pattern's sampling factor as the fraction of True nodes
in a mask over the total.  The period of repetition can still be known as the
stride.   Importantly, this allows one to achieve arbitrary sampling factors.
For instance, if one wanted to downsample by just 1%, you could have a stride
100 pattern with 99 true.

The problem with this is it is not symmetric with respect to phase.  How can we
achieve phase symmetry in convolutions?  The paper I bookmarked seemed to have
something of an answer to that.
