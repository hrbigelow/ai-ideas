The notion of bounded space

The space of all inputs for a neural system is bounded, since there is only a
limited range of stimuli that a neuron is sensitive to.  At the periphery, our
retinas can only handle brightness levels within a fixed range, and colors
within a fixed range.  Our ears can only handle frequencies and amplitudes in
fixed ranges.  The case is the same in every sense perception.

In an ANN, it seems sensible to either artificially limit the range of
activation values of neurons, or that this would naturally come out, given that
the ranges of inputs are limited.

So, given all of this, the picture that emerges is one of linear
transformations or separating hyperplanes, but now, envisioned in
hypercube-like bounded spaces.  This situation looks very different from
separating hyperplanes over unbounded spaces.  When applied to a hypercube
(whether hollow or filled or a discrete grid of points), a hyperplane clips off
a corner of a hypercube. 

The upshot is that, when considering a bounded space, a hyperplane divides the
space into two differently sized volumes.  This is not the case with an
unbounded space - in that case, every possible hyperplane divides the space
into two infinite-volume spaces.
