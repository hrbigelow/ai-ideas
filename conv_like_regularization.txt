Convolution-like Regularization in FC Layers

Instead of a traditional convolution, use a fully connected layer.  Then, to
promote locality of receptive field, introduce a regularization penalty proportional
to a 2D gaussian around the output node for the incoming weights.

Introduce a second, "weight-sharing" regularization penalty, that penalizes the weights
from being different if they have the same physical grid position offset from one layer
to the next.
