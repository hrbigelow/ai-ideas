WHAT IS A MANIFOLD, WHAT IS A GOOD REPRESENTATION?

I'm trying to answer a few interrelated questions.  First is, what is a
manifold?  The basic definition is something like:


The easiest, to me, way of conceptualizing manifolds is to imagine two or more
clouds of points in a high-dimensional latent space, and that each of these clouds
hovers around a different hyperplane.  The hyperplanes may intersect, but the extent
of the clouds are finite.

"A low-dimensional sub-volume of an ambient space in which the data
concentrates". 

This definition isn't meaningful unless you assume some additional constraints
on the shape or continuity of the sub-volume.  For example, how many dimensions
are appropriate?  And how smooth should the manifold be?  One can always
construct a continuous one-dimensional volume that goes through every data
point.  It will be extremely windy, and obviously would be an example of
extreme overfitting, by the criterion of expected distance from any new data.

Another question is, supposing you "like" the number of dimensions and overall
windiness of your manifold, is it necessary that every data point actually be
contained by it?  Or just that your data are "near" it?

In illustrations of manifolds in the Deep Learning text, it seems like a
